        <h2>The Largest Egyptian Pyramid</h2>
        <p>The Great Pyramids of Giza is the largest Egyptian 
            pyramid and the tomb of the Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Khufu.
            Built in the 26th century BC during a period of around 27 years,
            it is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only 
            on to remain largely intact. As part of the Giza Pyramid complex,
            it borders present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt.

        <p>The Great Sphinx of Giza is a limestone statue of a 
            reclinging sphinx, a mythical creature with the head
            of a human and the body a lion. Facing directly from the 
            west to the east, it stands on the Giza Plateau on the west
            bank of the Nile in Giza, Egypt. The face of the Sphinx
            appears to represent the pharoah Khafre.
